# Module 9B - Custom Profile Component

## Description
This is a React app built with Vite. It contains a profile component styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to use JSX
- How to style with inline CSS
- How to create and render functional components

## Challenges
Some issues I faced were trying to figure out the code for the dark mode and light mode. I realized that I messed up the code in the App.jsx, which is why it didn't work in the first place. I also faced some inital issues with the React and Vite setup, since I always use App.py instead of React and javascript. 

## Screenshot
Include a screenshot of your component.
